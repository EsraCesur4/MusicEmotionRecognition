# ðŸŽµ Spotify Mood Dataset Generator ðŸŽµ
This project uses the **Spotipy** library to fetch track features from Spotify playlists categorized by mood. Whether you're a data scientist, music lover, or just curious about the science of sound, this dataset gives you insights into what makes a song feel happy, sad, chill, or angry.

# What's in the Dataset?
The generated dataset consists of track features that describe the audio properties of songs. Hereâ€™s what each column means:

energy â€“ Intensity of a song (0 to 1). *More energy = more power!*
liveness â€“ Is it live or studio? *Higher values mean a live audience presence.*
tempo â€“ Beats per minute (BPM). *Faster songs = more movement!*
speechiness â€“ How much speech is in the track?
acousticness â€“ Higher means more acoustic, lower means more electronic.
instrumentalness â€“ Measures the presence of vocals. Close to 1? Probably an instrumental.
danceability â€“ Can you groove to it? *Higher values mean itâ€™s dance-floor-ready!*
duration_ms â€“ Track length in milliseconds.
loudness â€“ Measured in dB, higher is louder.
valence â€“ How happy or sad a song feels (0 = sad, 1 = happy).
mood â€“ The mood label (happy, sad, angry, chill).
